Genome-wide Identification of NAC Gene Family in Lens culinaris
This repository contains the code, data, and analysis scripts for the genome-wide identification and characterization of the NAC transcription factor gene family in Lens culinaris (lentil).

Project Overview
NAC transcription factors play vital roles in plant development, stress responses, and crop improvement. This project focuses on:

Identifying NAC gene family members in the Lens culinaris genome using BLASTx and domain verification techniques.

Classifying and predicting functional domains through Python-based machine learning models.

Performing chromosomal localization and evolutionary analyses.

Visualizing results using data analysis libraries and bioinformatics tools.

Features
Genome-wide analysis integrating sequence similarity and domain architecture.

Data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction using MEGA and Chimera.

Detailed chromosomal mapping of NAC genes across Fabaceae relatives.
